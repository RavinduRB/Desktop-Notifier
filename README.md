# 🚨 🖥️ Desktop Notifier Application

Ever get so focused on work that you forget to drink water? I built a lightweight Python desktop app that reminds you to hydrate at regular intervals.

With a minimal and intuitive interface, you can set the reminder frequency in minutes, and the app will gently notify you in the background. It's helping you stay healthy and productive 💪💧.
